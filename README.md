This unity project is a multigame containing three different games all accessible from a common menu. We have access to AppleCatcher, FulapyBird and BrickBreaker.

Apple Catcher :

    Control :
        Left Arrow : The boy moves to the left
        Right Arrow : The boy moves to the right
        
    You have only 3 lives, when you take a bomb, you lost 1 life, at 0 life it's game over.
    
    Goal :
        The goal of the game is to catch the most amount of apple.
    

Brick Breaker :

    Control :
    
        Left Arrow : Pad moves to the left
        
        Right Arrow : Pad moves to the right

    You have only 5 lives, when the ball fall, you lost 1 life, at 0 life it's game over.

    Goal :

        Destroy all the bricks to have a new level. The game is a bit hard and infinite, you can only finish the game by loosing, like an arcade game.

Furapi Bird :

    Control :
    
        Space : Jump

    If you hit a pipe you die.

    Goal :

        The objective is to have the best score possible, like the basic one, there is only 1 manner to finish the game, loose.

    You can have access to the menu by pressing escape. There is no menu for Furapi Bird because it's like cheating.
